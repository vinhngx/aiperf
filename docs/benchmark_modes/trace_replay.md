# Trace Replay

This tutorial takes you through an example trace replay profile. Trace Replay benchmarking helps reproduce performance benchmarking results for validation or testing your system under a specific load pattern.

## MoonCake Traces

Mooncake provides a specification and sample datasets for [traces](https://github.com/kvcache-ai/Mooncake?tab=readme-ov-file#-open-source-trace) that can be replayed for performance benchmarking.

In AIPerf, the trace must be defined in a jsonl file.

4 keys are available:
- "timestamp": the timing of request arrivals
- "input_length": the number of input tokens
- "output_length": the number of output tokens
- "hash_ids": [list of block hashes]



```json
{
    "timestamp": 0,
    "input_length": 655,
    "output_length": 52,
    "hash_ids": [46, 47]
}
```



## Profiling using a MoonCake Trace


```bash
echo \
'{"timestamp": 0, "input_length": 655, "output_length": 52, "hash_ids": [46, 47]}
{"timestamp": 10535, "input_length": 672, "output_length": 26, "hash_ids": [46, 47]}
{"timestamp": 27482, "input_length": 655, "output_length": 52, "hash_ids": [46, 47]}' \
> example_trace.jsonl

aiperf profile \
    -m deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B \
	--input-file example_trace.jsonl \
	--custom-dataset-type mooncake_trace
```

The code above will create an example trace file formatted in jsonl. AIPerf will use it to define the dataset and timing to replay the trace.
