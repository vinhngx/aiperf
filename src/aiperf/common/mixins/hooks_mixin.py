    """Mixin for a class to be able to provide hooks to its subclasses, and to be able to run them. A "hook" is a function
    that is decorated with a hook type (AIPerfHook), and optional parameters.

    In order to provide hooks, a class MUST use the `@provides_hooks` decorator to declare the hook types it provides.
    Only list hook types that you call `get_hooks` or `run_hooks` on, to get or run the functions that are decorated
    with those hook types.

    Provided hooks are recursively inherited by subclasses, so if a base class provides a hook,
    all subclasses will also provide that hook (without having to explicitly declare it, or call `get_hooks` or `run_hooks`).
    In fact, you typically should not get or run hooks from the base class, as this may lead to calling hooks twice.

    Hooks are registered in the order they are defined within the same class from top to bottom, and each class's hooks
    are inspected starting with hooks defined in the lowest level of base classes, moving up to the highest subclass.

    IMPORTANT:
    - Hook decorated methods from one class can be named the same as methods in their base classes, and BOTH will be registered.
    Meaning if class A and class B both have a method named `_initialize`, which is decorated with `@on_init`, and class B inherits from class A,
    then both `_initialize` methods will be registered as hooks, and will be run in the order A._initialize, then B._initialize.
    This is done without requiring the user to call `super()._initialize` in the subclass, as the base class hook will be run automatically.
    However, the caveat is that it is not possible to disable the hook from the base class without extra work, and if the user does accidentally
    call `super()._initialize` in the subclass, the base class hook may be called twice.
