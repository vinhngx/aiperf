"""User-centric rate timing strategy for KV cache benchmarking.

Simulates a realistic multi-turn chat scenario where at t=0 there is already a steady-state
of users at varying stages of their session. Over time, new users join and old users leave.

Maintains consistent timing between turns for each user (`turn_gap`), simulating real multi-turn chat.
This timing directly affects KV cache hit rates: gaps that are too short keep caches
artificially warm, while gaps that are too long allow cache entries to be evicted before reuse.

Virtual History & Start Order
-----------------------------
Simulates steady-state from t=0 by distributing users across the "session lifetime"
(the time from a user's first turn to their last, measured in gaps = session_turns - 1).

Each user is assigned a virtual "age" representing how far through their session they are:
- User 1 (oldest): virtually done - all turns completed before t=0, replaced immediately
- User N (youngest): just started - most turns remaining

The user who just finished (User 1) is replaced by a fresh user who fires first at t=0.
Other users fire in staggered order based on their position in the session lifetime.
This creates immediate user churn rather than waiting for the first natural completions.

Example: 15 users, 20 turns, 1.0 QPS
-------------------------------------------
 User | Turns | Time | Turn Visualization
-------------------------------------------
    1 |     - |    - | (All turns completed before t=0) ← User 1 is "virtually done"
   16 |    20 |   0s | ████████████████████ ← New user at t=0 with all turns remaining
    5 |     6 |   1s | ██████
    9 |    11 |   2s | ███████████
   13 |    16 |   3s | ████████████████
    2 |     2 |   4s | ██
    6 |     7 |   5s | ███████
   10 |    12 |   6s | ████████████
   14 |    17 |   7s | █████████████████
    3 |     3 |   8s | ███
    7 |     8 |   9s | ████████
   11 |    13 |  10s | █████████████
   15 |    18 |  11s | ██████████████████
    4 |     4 |  12s | ████
    8 |     9 |  13s | █████████
   12 |    14 |  14s | ██████████████

New User Spawn Timing
------------
The first new user is spawned at t=0, in order to replace user 1, who already
finished all their turns before t=0.

After that, new users are spawned throughout the benchmark, specified by the following formula:
`next_spawn_time = prev_spawn_time + (max_turns * turn_gap)`

This ensures that a new user is spawned at the correct time to maintain the turn_gap.
Note that this is an absolute schedule and will not be affected by response times.
