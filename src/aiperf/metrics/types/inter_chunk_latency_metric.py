    Calculates Inter Chunk Latency (ICL) for streaming responses.

    Inter Chunk Latency measures the time gaps between consecutive response chunks
    in a streaming response. For each request with multiple response chunks, this
    metric computes the time difference between each adjacent pair of chunks.

    Example:
        For a streaming response with chunks arriving at times [100ms, 150ms, 210ms]:
        ICL = [50ms, 60ms] (differences between consecutive timestamps)

    All ICL values from all requests are collected into a single list for
    statistical analysis across the entire benchmark run.

    Formula:
        ICL = [timestamps[i] - timestamps[i-1] for i in range(1, len(timestamps))]

    Note: Only applicable to streaming responses with at least 2 chunks.
